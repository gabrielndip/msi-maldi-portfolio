## Directory Overview

This directory contains a data analysis workflow for Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) data of brain tissue. The analysis is performed using R and the Cardinal package, and the workflow is documented in a Quarto file that executes a series of R scripts.

## Key Files

*   `msi_maldi_portfolio_workflow.qmd`: The main Quarto file that serves as the entry point for the analysis. It contains the narrative and code chunks that source the R scripts.
*   `scripts/`: This directory contains the R scripts that perform the actual analysis, broken down into sequential steps.
    *   `01_load_data.R`: Loads the raw MSI data.
    *   `02_preprocess_data.R`: Preprocesses the data (normalization, peak picking, etc.).
    *   `03_explore_data.R`: Generates quality control plots.
    *   `04_roi_crop.R`: Crops the data to a region of interest.
    *   `05_ssc_segmentation.R`: Performs spatial segmentation.
    *   `06_pca_analysis.R`: Conducts Principal Component Analysis.
    *   `07_extra_analysis.R`: Performs additional analyses like t-SNE and UMAP.
    *   `08_annotate_features.R`: Annotates significant features.
*   `data/`: This directory contains the raw MSI data in `.imzML` and `.ibd` formats.
*   `figures/`: This directory contains the figures generated by the analysis.
*   `tables/`: This directory contains tables generated by the analysis, such as the list of significant m/z features.
*   `msi_maldi_portfolio_workflow.html`: The rendered HTML output of the Quarto document, containing the full analysis report.

## Usage

The analysis can be run in two ways:

1.  **Interactive Execution (Recommended)**: Open the `msi_maldi_portfolio_workflow.qmd` file in RStudio and run the code chunks sequentially.
2.  **Running Scripts Sequentially**: Run the R scripts in the `scripts/` directory in numerical order.

The final output of the analysis is the `msi_maldi_portfolio_workflow.html` file, which can be opened in a web browser to view the complete report.
